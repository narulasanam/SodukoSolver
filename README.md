# SodukoSolver
Solving a sudoko is a NP Hard Problem. But using Various AI techniques of Constraint Satisfaction you can decrease it to polynomial
time. Techniques such as MRV (Most Restrictive Variable), LCV (Least Constraining Value), MCV (Most Constraining Variable) are used
to decrease the time complexity of the program.
